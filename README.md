# Reposiroty with the code for the project: "Global TEC forecasting for space weather application based on deep learning techniques"


# Hi! üëã

## üöÄ Description of the repo
The code of this repo has all the stages of the implementation of the project "Global TEC forecasting for space weather application based on deep learning techniques".  
The objective of this work is to present a global ionospheric prediction model based on deep learning able to forecast Total Electron Content 24 hours in advance under different space weather conditions. Three different deep learning (DL) techniques have been compared to select the most suitable for the purpose of an operational service: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
The repo covers all the steps of a Machine learning pipeline project:

- **Data acquisition or extract stage:** extract data from different sources.
- **Data preprocessing o transformation stage:** cleaning data, interpolation, splitting data, accommodation (train set, test set), validation set.
- **Modeling stage:** module for adjust parameters and training models using Deep Learning techniques like LSTM, GRU, and CNN. This project too include a module for create incremental models .
- **Evaluation of models:** metrics like loss function of the models, MSE, RMSE, and plots.


## üõ† Tools
During the development of this Python-based project, we use a code tracker and a data tracker. The tools used to cover these two trackers are GitHub, and DVC (Data Version Control) respectively.
